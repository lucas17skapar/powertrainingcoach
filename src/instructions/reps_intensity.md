# Clearly outlined reps, sets, intensities, etc.,
Make sure the reps, sets, intensities and all those relevant parameters are outlined in a clear and user-friendly manner. There should be no question marks, and one should understand things clearly when looking at the program. If convenient, create tables, one for each phase (e.g., week 1-4), and the next (week 5-8), etc. And clearly outline the exercises in numeral order, and possible supersets (separated by letters).
Make sure the exercises are outlined in a numerical order and that supersets are distinguished clearly (separated by letters, 1a vs. 1b for example).
