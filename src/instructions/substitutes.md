# Substitutes
For somewhat complex or at times, inconvenient or inaccessible exercises, you should always include some ideas of substitutes in a bottom section (a separate header—such as “substitutes” or similar’). This is applied to exercises such as Olympic weightlifting variations, seal rows, chest supported rows, Nordic hamstring curls, etc. Use common sense in this regard. It’s pretty evident which exercises this category falls into. Then, offer pragmatic substitutes that matches that category and its emphasis. For example, say the athlete cannot do chest supported rows, then offer simple DB bench rows. Or say they cannot perform ball throws at a wall (rotational), then give them explosive band rotations. Make sure substitutes are comparable. For example:
-          	Don’t replace a bench press throw with just a speed push up, offer a ballistic push up.
