# Ballistic Training
## Rep scheme for Med. Ball Throws
For medicine ball throws, think pragmatically and common-sensically for reps depending on the type of exercise. Anywhere from 3-10 reps. For example, for chest passes, opt for the higher range, say 6-10. For punches or hip rotational throws, 3-5 per side. But rarely, if ever below 3 for any medicine ball throw variation. That is way too limited stimulus, especially for most athletes that will be doing this program (that have not yet learned full-effort).
