# Plyometrics and Loaded Jumps
## Back Squat Jumps and Trap-Bar Jumps or Loaded Jumps
For back squat jumps and trap bar jumps, and similar loaded jumps, primary method = % of body mass (BM) for the external load (bar + plates).
Use these ballpark zones, then fine-tune with a quick test (below):
~30–60% BM for most fighters
- Note: many hex bars weigh 20–25 kg, and barbells normally 20kg. If the bar alone overshoots your target % for smaller athletes, use a lighter bar or dumbbells. Make sure to emphasize this in the program when these lifts are prescribed.
- Going heavier usually just kills flight time and mechanics.
If you’ve got tech: auto-regulate with jump height (contact mat/app) or bar velocity (LPT). Otherwise, simply go by intuition and go full-effort on each jump.

## Rep Scheme for Plyometrics and Loaded Jumps
Depending on the nature of the jumping exercise stick to anywhere from 3 reps to 10 reps even. For example, depth jumps are very intense and should normally be done along the lines of 3-5. Pogo jumps are relatively light, and can be done up to 10, and sometimes up to 20. Loaded jumps can be done 3-5 usually. Very rarely (if ever) stay below 3 reps for any jump, as that is too little stimulus and too time consuming with regards to rest periods. Apply similar pragmatic and common sensical thinking.
### Simple prescriptions (per set)
- Extensive/stiffness work (pogos, ankling, low-hurdle hops): 10–30 contacts
- Jumps for height/distance (CMJ, box jump, broad jump): 3–6 reps
- Depth/shock jumps: 2–5 reps
- Loaded jumps (trap-bar/back-squat jumps): 3–5 reps

    Progression knobs: Volume (contacts/sets) → Intensity (height/load/approach speed) → Complexity (depth → rebound → hurdle series). You can even progress complexity in the form of complexes, such as start from knees, to jump up, to broad jump for instance. Combining that is. Or Single-leg variations depending on the context and the athlete and their sport.

## Assume competency in plyometrics
Unless otherwise stated, assume the athlete is competent in basic plyometrics, so you don’t need to include overly simplistic variations such as depth drop to stick for instance.
